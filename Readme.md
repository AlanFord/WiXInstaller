Excel-DNA - WiXInstaller
------------------------

This is a user-contributed template (thank you very much to Lee Zeitz!) for making a WiX-based installer for an Excel-DNA add-in.

To use this, you will need Visual Studio, and to install the WiX toolset: https://wix.codeplex.com/

Some of the WiX project files also need unique Guids to be inserted for your project.

WARNING: I have not been able to make a working installer based on this project. I publish it in the hope that it might still be useful as a starting point, and to invite contributions to improve the installer template.
